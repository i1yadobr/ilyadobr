# This is a Linux script to build and run the server in a Docker container
# Make sure that you have Docker installed and Docker Daemon/Engine is running
# This script will stop any existing containers named `zeroonyx` and will remove any images named `zeroonyx-server`

# This script must be started from the root folder of the build
# This script will automatically mount your config/ and data/ folders into the container.
# Please adjust the `docker run` command if you want to change this behavior.

# After successful start you will be able to connect to your local server with the following address: `localhost:14076`.
# Port 14076 is used by default, but may be changed in the `Dockerfile`.

# Note that by default the `host` networking mode is used.
# You may switch networking mode from host to an internal network, but all connected players will have the same IP.
